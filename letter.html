    <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">To: Ninaa (yes, with the double A because you're that special mwehehe)</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Hey Ninaa :)</p>

    <p class="mb-4">So I don’t know how to start this without sounding super cheesy, but here goes nothing.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I’ve been meaning to say this for a while now and I figured graduation night was the perfect time. I'm writing this with a mix of butterflies and late-night feelings, probably a little too emotional from the whole “we're done with high school” thing. But more than anything, I’m thinking about you.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I still remember the first time we met. March 20, 2024, during our Grade 11 recollection. Honestly, I didn't expect that day to stick with me as much as it did. But then you showed up, and I saw your eyes. Those pretty eyes. They seriously made me pause for a second. Not kidding, I think I got distracted mid-prayer because of you. Sorry, Lord.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Fast forward to Valentine’s Day. I gave you a flower. Not just any flower, but your favorite one, the lily, and I made sure it had your other favorite color, violet. I didn’t say too much then, but the truth is, I gave it to you because that day reminded me of you. Simple. Sweet. Just like how I see you.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">And now, here I am, writing this while graduation just happened. You looked so pretty out there, walking proudly between your mom and dad. I had to pretend to look away so people wouldn't see me smiling like an idiot. You honestly stole the show.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I know from your friends that you're really focused on your studies right now, and I honestly admire that about you. It shows how driven and thoughtful you are. I just want you to know that I’m here. I’m willing to wait, no matter how long. I’m not asking for anything big. I just hope that maybe someday, we get to talk more, even just a little. For now, I’ll be quietly cheering you on, proud of the person you’re becoming, and hoping that one day, our paths get a little closer.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">This isn’t some dramatic movie moment or anything. Just a real letter from a real guy who caught feelings for a real, amazing girl.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">So yeah… I like you, Ninaa. And I hope this made you smile, even just a little.</p>

    <p>From the guy who still can’t get over your eyes, <br>Luke <3</p>
